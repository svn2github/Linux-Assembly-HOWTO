<h3>Proposal for the "Linux Assembly Programming" book</h3>

<blockquote>
<p align=justify>
   The book will try to cover the topic of Linux IA-32 <!-- and IA-64 --> assembly 
   programming as much as possible, starting with assembly pros and cons, and
   ending with an implementation of libc in assembly language. The book will
   cover the process of development Linux applications in assembly language,
   general portability issues, tips and tricks.
<p align=justify>
   The Book  will include a lot of code examples, several appendices, 
   and Q&A chapter. In general,  the book will be nicely technical,
   and will carry research spirit through all its pages.
   The book will lead the reader from simple explanatory chapters
   to hard-core assembly code examples.
<p align=justify>
   This book is absolutely outstanding and unique. I do not know any other
   books covering this topic. Linux assembly programming is a brand new
   branch of Linux application development. The book is based on unique
   research.
<p align=justify>
   The topic of Linux assembly programming is gaining more and more interest,
   especially in educational and embedded systems fields.
<p align=justify>
   Mostly the book is targeted on assembly professionals, who do not
   know Linux, and on Linux professionals who do not know assembly.
   <b>
   NOTE: this is not "a tutorial on PC assembly", it is assumed that
   reader already knows assembly language, at least basics of it.
   </b>
</blockquote>

   Audience:

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>education field (anyone who teaches assembly, more and more teachers
   would like to use NASM and Linux in their courses instead of MASM and DOS)
<li>software engineers and system programmers
<li>embedded system & application developers
<li>and just Linux and assembly hackers
</ul>

<p align=justify>
   The book will be a great tutorial on Linux assembly, so it can
   be easily used in existing assembly training courses, as well
   as in Linux application development courses.
</blockquote>

  Benefits:

<blockquote>
<p align=justify>
   The person will:
<ul>
<li>learn when to use assembly, and when not (in general)
<li>learn the process of writing Linux applications in assembly
<li>learn system calls details and will be able to use them
<li>be able to port an existing DOS assembly codebase to Linux
<li>be able to build the smallest possible Linux distribution
<li>get plenty of source code examples
</ul>
</blockquote>

  Requirements:

<blockquote>
<p align=justify>
   General assembly language knowledge is required to
   understand some parts of the book (there will be no
   explanation of what is "mov", "jmp", register, protected mode, etc).
<p align=justify>
   At least, person must be familiar with any programming
   language and development.
<p align=justify>
   Linux knowledge is preferred but not required.
   Nasm experience is preferred but not required.
</blockquote>

  Supplementary material:

<blockquote>
<p align=justify>
   I would like to provide a supplementary CD with the book,
   with all source code examples, and all tools described in the
   book, may be even with some Linux distribution (i.e. Stampede),
   so reader can start from scratch (almost all software provided is GPL'ed).
   Some of the material will be posted on the web (system call list),
   because it will be updating frequently (certainly with free access)
</blockquote>

  Status:

<blockquote>
<p align=justify>
   The book is not complete yet. There's a lot of material, but
   it needs to be organized in a form of a book. However there
   are several chapters that are almost complete.
   Estimated page count - ~300 p.
   The book will include several figures/tables (max 10), possibly some
   diagrams (2-3), and possibly a drawing/photo for each chapter (max 10).
<p align=justify>
   It is possible that there will be few co-authors, or just
   people who will contribute some chapters.
