><P
>Often you will be told that using 
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>C library</SPAN
> (<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>libc</SPAN
>)
is the only way, and direct system calls are bad.
This is true. To some extent.
In general, you must know that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> is not sacred,
and in <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

You can easily do this in your program as well (if you need to),
and your program will be dozen times smaller, and this will result
in improved performance as well, just because you're not using
shared libraries (static binaries are faster).
Using or not using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> in assembly programming
is more a question of taste/belief than something practical.
Remember, Linux is aiming to be POSIX compliant,
so does <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
>.
This means that syntax of almost all
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> "system calls"
exactly matches syntax of real kernel system calls (and vice versa).
Besides,
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNU libc</SPAN
>(<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>glibc</SPAN
>)
becomes slower and slower from version to version,
and eats more and more memory; and so,
cases of using direct system calls become quite usual.
However, the main drawback of throwing <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> away
is that you will possibly need to implement several
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libc</SPAN
> specific functions
(that are not just syscall wrappers) on your own
(<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>printf()</TT

and you are ready for that, aren't you? :-)</P

>Size is much better saved by having some kind

(the interpreter itself could be written either in C or assembly.)
The best way to keep multiple binaries small is
to not have multiple binaries, but instead
to have an interpreter process files with
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#!</TT
> prefix.
This is how OCaml works when used in wordcode mode
(as opposed to optimized native code mode),
and it is compatible with using the libc.
This is also how Tom Christiansen's
Perl PowerTools reimplementation of unix utilities works.
Finally, one last way to keep things small,
that doesn't depend on an external file with a hardcoded path,
be it library or interpreter,
is to have only one binary,
and have multiply-named hard or soft links to it:
the same binary will provide everything you need in an optimal space,
with no redundancy of subroutines or useless binary headers;
it will dispatch its specific behavior
according to its <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>argv[0]</I
></TT
>;
in case it isn't called with a recognized name,
it might default to a shell,
and be possibly thus also usable as an interpreter!</P
