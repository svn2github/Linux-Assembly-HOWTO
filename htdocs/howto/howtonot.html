>2.2.2. Languages with optimizing compilers</H2
><P
>Languages like ObjectiveCAML, SML, CommonLISP, Scheme, ADA, Pascal, C, C++,
among others, all have free optimizing compilers
that will optimize the bulk of your programs,
and often do better than hand-coded assembly even for tight loops,
while allowing you to focus on higher-level details,
and without forbidding you to grab
a few percent of extra performance in the above-mentioned way,
once you've reached a stable design.
Of course, there are also commercial optimizing compilers
for most of these languages, too!</P
><P
>Some languages have compilers that produce C code,
which can be further optimized by a C compiler:
LISP, Scheme, Perl, and many other.
Speed is fairly good.</P

>Finally, before you end up writing assembly,
you should inspect generated code,
to check that the problem really is with bad code generation,
as this might really not be the case:
compiler-generated code might be better than what you'd have written,
particularly on modern multi-pipelined architectures!
Slow parts of a program might be intrinsically so.
The biggest problems on modern architectures with fast processors
are due to delays from memory access, cache-misses, TLB-misses,
and page-faults;
register optimization becomes useless,
and you'll more profitably re-think data structures and threading
to achieve better locality in memory access.
Perhaps a completely different approach to the problem might help, then.</P

Here is what you'll do with such code:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>check whether generated code
can be obviously enhanced with hand-coded assembly
(or by tweaking compiler switches)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>when that's the case,
start from generated code and modify it
instead of starting from scratch</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>more generally, use generated code as stubs to modify,
which at least gets right the way

></LI
><LI
><P
>track down bugs in your compiler (hopefully the rarer)</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>The standard way to have assembly code be generated
is to invoke your compiler with the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-S</TT
> flag.
This works with most Unix compilers,
including the GNU C Compiler (GCC), but YMMV.
As for GCC, it will produce more understandable assembly code with
the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-fverbose-asm</TT
> command-line option.
Of course, if you want to get good assembly code,
don't forget your usual optimization options and hints!</P
