>3.4.1. AS86</H2
><P
>AS86 is a 80x86 assembler (16-bit and 32-bit) with integrated macro support.
It has mostly Intel-syntax, though it differs slightly as for addressing modes.
Some time ago it was used in a several projects, including the Linux kernel,
but eventually most of those projects have moved to GAS or NASM.
AFAIK, only ELKS continues to use it.</P
><P
>AS86 can be found at
<A
HREF="http://www.cix.co.uk/~mayday/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.cix.co.uk/~mayday/</A
>,
in bin86 package with linker (ld86), or as separate archive.
Documentation is available as the man page and as.doc from the source package.
When in doubt, the source code itself is often a good doc: though it is not
very well commented, the programming style is straightforward.
You might try to see how as86 is(was) used in ELKS, LILO, or Tunes 0.0.0.25...</P

>Note: </B
>A completely outdated version 0.4 of AS86 is distributed by HJLu
just to compile the Linux kernel versions prior to 2.4,
in a package named bin86, available in any Linux GCC repository.
But I advise no one to use it for anything else but compiling Linux.
This version supports only a hacked minix object file format,
which is not supported by the GNU binutils or anything,
and it has a few bugs in 32-bit mode,
so you really should better keep it only for compiling Linux.</P

Another primary module of the overall design is an optimizer module.</P

FASM only requires the source code to include the information it really needs.

It runs on DOS/Windows/Linux and can produce
flat binary, DOS EXE, Win32 PE, COFF and Linux ELF output.

a set of advanced features including symbol scopes, an expressions engine,
big integer support, macro capability, numerous and accurate warning messages...
Its dynamic modular architecture enables Aasm to extend its set of features
with plug-ins by taking advantages of dynamic libraries.</P
><P
>The input module supports Intel syntax (like nasm, tasm, masm, etc.).
The x86 assembler module supports all opcodes up to P6 including MMX, SSE
and 3DNow! extensions. F-CPU and SPARC assembler modules are under development.
Several output modules are available for ELF, COFF, IntelHex, and raw binary formats.</P

It uses a high level language like syntax
(similar to Pascal, C/C++, and other HLLs) for variable declarations,
procedure declarations, and procedure calls. It uses a modified
assembly language syntax for the standard machine instructions.
It also provides several high level language style control structures
(if, while, repeat..until, etc.) that help you write much more readable code.</P
><P
>HLA is free and comes with source, Linux and Win32 versions available.
On Win32 you need MASM and a 32-bit version of MS-link on Win32,
on Linux you nee GAS, because HLA produces specified assembler code
and uses that assembler for final assembling and linking.</P

It extends traditional untyped assembly languages with typing annotations,
memory management primitives, and a sound set of typing rules, to guarantee
the memory safety, control flow safety,and type safety of TAL programs.
Moreover, the typing constructs are expressive enough to encode
most source language programming features including records and structures,
arrays, higher-order and polymorphic functions, exceptions, abstract data types,
subtyping, and modules. Just as importantly,
TAL is flexible enough to admit many low-level compiler optimizations.
Consequently, TAL is an ideal target platform for type-directed compilers
that want to produce verifiably safe code
for use in secure mobile code applications
or extensible operating system kernels.</P

However, it is evil proprietary software.
It is said that there was a project for a free clone somewhere,
that was abandoned after worthless pretenses that the syntax
would be owned by the original author.
Thus, if you're looking for
a nifty programming project related to assembly hacking,
I invite you to develop a terse-syntax frontend to NASM,
if you like that syntax.</P
