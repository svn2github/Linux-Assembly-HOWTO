<h3>Linux Assembly Programming</h3>
( a story about a book that no one wants to publish )

<p>
During the fall of 1999 I've got an intention to write a book
on Linux Assembly Programming. I was getting more and more
questions on the topic from various people,
and thought that it be would nice to write a book,
which will be useful in educational processes,
useful to embedded software engineers, Linux developers,
former DOS assembly programmers, and assembly hackers in general.
The book seemed to be unique. But..
<p>
I've contacted several publishers
(including O'REILLY, Addison Wesley, Wiley &amp; Sons, etc).
All of them declined interest.
Some of them decided that I am just crazy,
others found the book interesting,
but haven't found the real market for it.
They say, assembly language programming is fast becoming a Lost Art,
so the book would not sell.
<p>
Unfortunately I can't afford myself to work on this book on voluntary basis.
Writing a *real* book takes a lot of effort (both technical and non-technical)
and plenty of time (i.e. it isn't a lot of fun).
If I had needed resources then I've already published the book on my own,
because I KNOW that there's a real market for the book.
<p>
No way out? You can help!
If you're a publisher, examine the proposal below.
If you are a company/educational organization,
request this book from some publisher.
If you are just a hacker, shake your local publisher/bookstore
for a book on Linux Assembly Programming.
In one word, prove that there's market for this book!
Possibly at some point we will have to collect pre-orders,
so stay tuned.
